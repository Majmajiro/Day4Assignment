Project Management
Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?  Timely delivery in software project management is crucial because it keeps clients happy, avoids extra costs, and ensures the product stays relevant.                                                                                                    To meet deadlines, project managers can: Plan well – Set clear goals and break tasks into smaller steps, Prioritize tasks – Focus on what’s most important first, Communicate often – Keep the team and clients updated, Manage risks – Identify and solve problems early, Use the right tools – Track progress with project management software and Stay flexible – Adjust plans when needed to stay on track.
How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns? Effective cost control helps a software project succeed by keeping expenses within budget, preventing financial waste, and ensuring the project is completed without running out of money. Strategies to prevent budget overruns are; setting a clear budget, tracking all spending, planning for surprises, avoiding adding too many extra features, assigning tasks efficiently to save time & money, communicating often, reviewing and adjusting budgets. 
Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each? Agile is flexible while Waterfall is more structured and linear, agile works in small cycles or sprints while waterfall follows a phase to phase approach, Agile is easy to make changes but Waterfall is harder to adjust once started, Agile involves customers continuously while waterfall involves the customer at the start and end of the project, Agile delivers in small parts but Waterfall delivers the entire project at the end, Agile is best for uncertain but evolving projects but Waterfall is for well defined projects.

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? Agile is better for projects that need flexibility, frequent updates, and ongoing customer feedback. Examples are, Mobile apps, ecommerce websites, game development. Waterfall is better for projects with clear requirements, strict deadlines, and minimal expected changes. Examples are infrastructure and management software, governement projects and banking systems.

What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards? Set clear standards – Define what "good quality" means from the start, Test early and often – Find and fix bugs before they become big problems, Use automated testing – Run tests quickly and repeatedly to catch errors, Perform code reviews – Have team members check each other’s work, Get user feedback – Let real users test and suggest improvements, Track issues – Use tools to log and fix bugs efficiently, Follow best practices – Stick to coding standards and guidelines. Maintaining high standards is important because it ensures the software is reliable, secure, and user-friendly.

How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful? Defining the project scope helps with successful planning by setting clear goals, tasks, and limits for the project. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a way to break a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It looks like a tree or list, with the big project at the top and smaller tasks below.

What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process? Keeps the project on track by helping to meet deadlines, Improves time management by ensuring tasks are completed in order, Prevents confusion ensuring everyone knows what to do and when, Identifies risks early by helping spot delays before they become big problems, Better resource planning by ensuring the right people work on the right tasks. Gantt Charts help by their Visual timelines that show tasks, deadlines and progress; helps see which tasks rely on others with task dependencies and easily updating and monitoring statues of the project.

What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
